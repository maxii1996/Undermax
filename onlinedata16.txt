This is an  \color[#1bff17] Online Text From  \color[#ff6bf5] GitHub<br> \color[#ffffff]

You can use your own URL obviously xD

\fs[33]Now you can use icons too: \localicon[87] \fs[22]

We can use local commands for example:


- \color[#21ffff] Variable #2 ingame: \localvariable[2] \color[#ffffff] <br>
-  My Main Character is:  \color[#61c0ff]  \localparty[1, name] 



 \color[#ffffff] 

Too much text? 

You can scroll the text with the arrows!! :D
